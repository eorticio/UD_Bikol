An adjectival modifier of a nominal is any adjectival phrase that modifies
the meaning of the nominal head.

May turista na puti nagduman sa San Jose. \n There is a white tourist that visited San Jose.
amod(turista, puti)

While most adjectival modifiers are attached after the nominal head with 
the linking word na, some adjectives may also come directly before the 
nouns they modify.
